# Creating-Customer-Segment
Unsupervised ML Project for Udacity ML Engineer Nanodegree

Project Description
This is a project for the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. In this project I applied unsupervised learning techniques on product spending data collected for customers of a wholesale distributor to identify customer segments hidden in the data.

Initially data was explored to determine if any product categories highly correlates with one another by observing a small subset of the data and also by ploting a scater matrix. Afterwards, the data was preprocessed by scaling each product category and then identifying (and removing) unwanted outliers. Then PCA transformations was applied to the data and clustering algorithm GMM (Gaussian Mixture Model)was implemented to segment the transformed customer data. Finally, the segments were compared and found with an additional labeling and how this information could assist the wholesale distributor with future service changes.

Install

This project requires Python 2.7 and the following Python libraries installed:

NumPy

Pandas

matplotlib

scikit-learn

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer.

Code
The main code for this project is located in the customer_segments.ipynb notebook file. 

Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory customer_segments/ (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

ipython notebook customer_segments.ipynb
or

jupyter notebook customer_segments.ipynb
This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

Data
The customer segments data is included as a selection of 440 data points collected on data found from clients of a wholesale distributor in Lisbon, Portugal. More information can be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
